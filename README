GPUCalc
-------

A GPU calculator for UC/CSU a-g requirements.

An AJAX-based web page allows students to enter their UC-approved courses,
visualize the results, and verify that they fulfill the requirements for
admission.  The GPU is properly computed using extra points for honors/AP
courses, adjustments for repeated courses, and all the other factors that
are described on the official UC Doorways website.

Data for each school's approved courselist is scraped from the official
UC Doorways website using the scrape_a2g Python script to extrac the
course names and attributes.
